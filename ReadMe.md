# Decision Tree Classifier Using C++

We focus on implementing an end to end decision tree classifer library which can take your input data, perform train test split, deliver a machine learning model and display metrics all using C++.The goal is to use c++ and mathematical concepts of decision tree to implement this basic classifier project.


### Components
Our implementation uses 4 .cpp files with three of their  header files included 

For compiling , run the following command in the terminam

```
g++ Main.cpp data_handler.cpp decision_tree.cpp inference.cpp -o <name_of_your_own_choice> 
```

To run the file,run the following command in the terminal
```
    ./<name_of_your_own_choice>
```
